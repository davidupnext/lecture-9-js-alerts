In many cases, when you head to a website, you can navigate to various web pages within a domain by changing (or adding) path. 

This is done clicking on a link, or manually typing in the URL into the browswer.

For example, you can head to www.example.com or you can navigate to www.example.com/about (if the web master created this URL).

You can do something similar with Flask too! instead of using `@app.route('/')`, you can redirect to `@app.route('/about')` or any path that is available on a server.
